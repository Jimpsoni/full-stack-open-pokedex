I chose Python as my language. I found that there are many free tools on the internet 

## Linting: 

For linting, there are tools such as Ruff and Sonar. There is also pyType used by Google for many of their Python projects. Ruff and pyType are free and opensource, Sonar is also free, but not opensource. 

## Testing: 

Python has many frameworks to help with testing the code. BrowserStack listed Behave, Lettuce, Robot and Pytest frameworks as their top 4 picks. 

 

## Building: 

Python has automated build tools such as PyBuilder.  

 

## CI tools 

Googling “setting CI” gives us options such as GitLab CI, Azure Pipelines, Travis CI and CircleCI etc... 

 

I guess it really depends on the nature of the project. If we have a long project that is never “finished” I guess we would then use self-hosted CI/CD. But we have a clear goal and endpoint we would prefer cloud-based environment. Also depends on the scale of the project. If we have a large project , we would prefer to use self-hosting and on smaller projects we would prefer to use cloud-based hosting. Six people on the could be large enough to use self-hosting, but in this case I guess I would go with the cloud-based hosting.
